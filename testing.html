	<h1> Testing: General </h1>
	<br>
	<h3> Automated Testing </h3>
		<p> A technique of designing tests that can be run automatically, repeatedly, and easily compare results across tests.  Requires extensive customization, so only good for things that need to be tested in the same way repeatedly, and frequently. <p>
			<p> One example being: You may want to have an automated test that builds the project once and hour to check for breaks, and send an automatic email to the development team if there is a problem.  This speeds up development cycle. </p>
			<p> Not good when massive changes are undergone, perhaps frequently. </p>
	<br>
	<h3> Bug Tracking </h3>
		<p> Software, a database, that tracks bugs, and can be queried in several ways, including version.  This is important for large projects that might have 100's of bugs each on say, different browsers.  This allows support to quickly aid customers. </p> 
	<br>
	<h3> Unit Testing </h3>
		<p> This is used by the developers (although possibly tests are designed by the testers) and it tests on a small scale, specific functions or whatnot.  This is in comparison with large scale bug testing, which tests a finished product.  Better unit tests avoid repeated full testing cycles.</p>
	<h3> Coverage Tools </h3>
		<p> These are tools that try to track if certain things have been tested.  They check and see if all paths through the software have been tested on, and when something is missed, that can be a reason to create a new unit test.  Think of it as a standardized way of tracking what has and hasn't been tested and how much, as opposed to just keeping notes on it somewhere, and decided what to test more or less on the fly. </p>
